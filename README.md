This is a project Git repository for my Google Homepage

This is my attempt at the Odin Project course.

In this project, learned the process of adding all element on a html page first, then styling it all to look the way it should after the fact.

I used this project to get used to GitBash and using periodic commits after implementation stages were complete.

Learnt:
  - HTML, CSS
  - Flexbox
  - media queries / responsiveness
  - going over finer detail (of google.com) getting extra small details that would help in final product
  - left out getting Google font and used an image for overall look.

There are many different looks to Google Homepage personally, mine has recent history, a tessalation wallpaper, a customize button. But wanted to keep simple as possible to example given.
